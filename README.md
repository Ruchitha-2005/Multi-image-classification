This project implements a deep learning pipeline for multi-class image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The training notebook prepares image data with augmentation, builds a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras, and visualizes performance through accuracy and loss plots. The trained model is saved and later used in the testing notebook, which loads unseen images to evaluate predictions and display classification results with confidence scores. Together, these notebooks provide a complete workflow for developing, training, and testing an image classifier, making it suitable for real-world applications such as automated image tagging and visual recognition tasks.
